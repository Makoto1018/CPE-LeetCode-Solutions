### code
1. 自己寫的
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT l1.num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM Logs AS l1, Logs AS l2, Logs AS l3
WHERE l1.id = l2.id-1 and l2.id = l3.id-1 AND l1.id = l3.id-2 and l1.id != l2.id and l2.id != l3.id AND l1.id != l3.id and l1.num = l2.num and l2.num =l3.num;
```
2. LAG()，Window Function
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM (
    SELECT num,
           LAG(num, 1) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev1,
           LAG(num, 2) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS prev2
    FROM Logs
) AS sub
WHERE num = prev1 AND num = prev2;

```
