### code
1. 自己寫的
```sql
SELECT e1.employee_id,
       e1.name, 
       COUNT(*)AS reports_count, 
       ROUND(AVG(e2.age)::NUMERIC) AS average_age
FROM Employees e1
JOIN Employees e2
ON e1.employee_id = e2.reports_to
GROUP BY e1.employee_id, e1.name
ORDER BY e1.employee_id;
```

2. CTE版本
```sql
WITH ReportStats AS (
  SELECT 
    reports_to AS manager_id,
    COUNT(*) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(age)::NUMERIC) AS average_age
  FROM Employees
  WHERE reports_to IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY reports_to
)

SELECT 
  e.employee_id,
  e.name,
  rs.reports_count,
  rs.average_age
FROM Employees e
JOIN ReportStats rs
  ON e.employee_id = rs.manager_id
ORDER BY e.employee_id;

```
